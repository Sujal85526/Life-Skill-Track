# Deep Work 

## Question 1: What is Deep Work?

Deep Work is when you focus fully on one important task without distractions.

- No phone
- No social media
- No random notifications
- Just you and the work

Examples:

- Coding
- Studying
- Writing
- Solving tough problems

Why Deep Work helps:

- Learn faster
- Do harder things
- Produce better quality work

Shallow work (opposite of deep work):

- Checking emails
- Scrolling Instagram
- Switching tasks again and again

## Question 3: How can you implement the principles in your day-to-day life?

Simple daily rules:

- Decide 1–2 high-priority tasks per day
- Do them first thing in the morning (if possible)
- Keep phone away during focus time
- Use time blocks (Pomodoro or 60–90 mins)
- Take real breaks (walk, stretch, silence)

Example daily plan:

- 9:00–10:30 → Deep work (study/coding)
- 10:30–10:45 → Break
- After that → shallow work
