# Sexual Harassment — Quick Q&A ✅

## 1) What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Any unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that makes someone feel uncomfortable, intimidated, humiliated, or unsafe. Examples:

- **Verbal:** sexually suggestive comments, jokes, remarks about appearance, sexual questions, or pressure for sexual favours.
- **Physical:** unwanted touching, hugging, kissing, caressing.
- **Non‑verbal / Digital:** sharing explicit images or messages, leering, sexual gestures, offensive body language.
- **Power‑related:** quid pro quo (offering or withholding work benefits in exchange for sexual favours) or repeated acts creating a hostile work environment.

## 2) What should you do if you face or witness such behaviour?

- **Immediate / safety first:** if safe, tell the person it’s unwelcome, move away, and get help from a colleague or friend.
- **Document:** note date/time/location, what happened, who was involved, and save messages or photos.
- **Report:** follow your organisation’s PoSH/HR procedure (report to ICC/HR, file a written complaint if needed); escalate to external authorities if internal steps fail.
- **If you witness:** check on the person, offer support and help report, or report the incident yourself if they feel unsafe.

**Principles to remember:** Respect and consent are non-negotiable; harassment is judged by its effect, not intent; you have a right to a safe workplace.
