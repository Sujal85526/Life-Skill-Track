## Learning Techniques Q&A

### Question 1
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**  
→ The Feynman Technique is a method of learning by explaining a concept in simple words as if teaching it to a 5-year-old.

### Question 2
**In this video (Barbara Oakley – Learning How to Learn), what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
One of the most interesting ideas is how the brain switches between “focused mode” and “diffused mode”, and how taking breaks or sleeping actually helps your brain solve problems you were stuck on — just like a pinball bouncing freely when you stop forcing it.

### Question 3
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

- **Active (Focused) Mode:** When you concentrate deeply on something — solving a problem, reading code, studying. Your brain is in “laser focus”.
- **Diffused Mode:** When your mind is relaxed — walking, showering, resting — allowing creative connections and new ideas to form.
- Both are needed for good learning.

### Question 4
**According to “Learn Anything in 20 Hours”, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?**  
Steps:
- Deconstruct the skill (break it into smaller parts).
- Learn just enough to self-correct.
- Remove distractions.
- Practice at least 20 hours with full focus.

### Question 5
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

Here are practical actions based on everything above:
- Use the Feynman Technique – explain every new topic in simple words.
- Study in focused blocks (Pomodoro / deep work).
- Remove distractions – silence phone, block social media during study.
- Alternate between focused and diffused mode – take short breaks to reset.
- Break any topic into smaller chunks before learning (deconstruction).
- Do active coding instead of just reading — implement everything.
- Track your study time using an app (Boosted or any tracker).
- Review concepts by teaching them to someone or writing notes.
- Set small deadlines so you don’t stretch topics forever.
- Communicate proactively when you get stuck.
- Practice problems consistently — not just theory.
- Make learning enjoyable — curiosity > pressure.
