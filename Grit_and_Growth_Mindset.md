## Grit and Growth Mindset (Short Notes for Me)

Grit means **sticking with an important long‑term goal** and **working hard**, even when it is boring or difficult.  
Steady effort over time usually matters more than talent or high IQ.

## Q1: What is grit? (Angela Duckworth video)

**Short idea:**  
Grit = **passion + perseverance for long‑term goals**.

- People with grit:
  - **Care about a goal for a long time**, not just for a few days.
  - **Keep working** even when they fail or feel tired.
  - **Treat life like a marathon**, not a sprint.
- Talent and IQ **do not guarantee success**.  
  What matters more is **showing up every day** and putting in effort over years.

## Q2: What is a Growth Mindset?

**Fixed mindset:**  
- “I am either smart or not.”  
- “Skills are **born**, not built.”  
- “If I fail, it means I am not good.”

**Growth mindset:**  
- “Skills are **built** with effort, practice, and learning.”  
- “If I fail, it means I can **learn and improve**.”  
- “Mistakes, feedback, and challenges help me grow.”

People with a growth mindset:
- Focus on **learning**, not just marks or results.
- See **effort** as useful, not as a sign of weakness.
- Use **feedback and failure** to get better over time.

## Q3: What is Internal Locus of Control?

**Internal locus of control** means:
- I believe **my actions, effort, and decisions** mostly create my results.
- I do **not just blame** luck, other people, or circumstances.

**Key point from the video:**
- When I think **“my effort matters”**, I:
  - Try harder.
  - Take on more difficult problems.
  - Keep going instead of giving up.
- This belief keeps my **motivation high**, even when things are tough.

## Q4: How to Build a Growth Mindset (Key Points Only)

- **Question your assumptions and negative stories.**
- **Create your own curriculum or plan for growth.**
- **Honor the struggle and see challenges as part of growth.**

## Q5: My Action Plan to Build a Growth Mindset (as a Software Developer Trainee)

**1. Learn from bugs and failures**
- When I see an error or bug, I will ask:  
  **“What can this teach me?”**  
  I will write down:
  - What went wrong.
  - What I learned.
  - How I will avoid it next time.

**2. Focus on process goals, not only results**
- Instead of only thinking “I want a good job quickly,” I will set **daily process goals**, for example:
  - **2 DSA problems** every day.
  - **1 code review or small project improvement** every day.
- Process goals keep me moving, even when results are slow.

**3. Choose slightly uncomfortable challenges**
- I will regularly pick tasks that feel **a bit hard**, such as:
  - Harder LeetCode / DSA problems.
  - A new tech stack or library.
  - A tool I have never used before.
- I will **stick with them long enough** to see progress, not quit at the first difficulty.

**4. Ask for feedback and use it**
- I will:
  - Ask mentors, friends, or seniors to **review my code**.
  - **Write down their feedback** in a simple list (e.g., naming, structure, readability, tests).
  - In the next task, I will **focus on improving those points** on purpose.

**5. Use “yet” language with myself**
- Instead of saying:
  - “I don’t understand this pattern.”
  - “I can’t solve this bug.”
- I will say:
  - “I don’t understand this pattern **yet**.”
  - “I can’t solve this bug **yet**.”
- This reminds me that **skills can be built** with time and effort.

## One-Line Reminder for Myself

“I can grow with effort, smart practice, feedback, and time — my future is built by what I do every day.”
