## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

**Q1: Most interesting story?**  
BJ Fogg’s tiny habit was one push-up after every bathroom break. Because it was so small, he never skipped it and it grew into full workouts.

**Why it stands out**
- Small steps lead to big changes.
- Tiny actions do not need high motivation.
- Repeating tiny wins builds the “I’m fit” identity.

## 2. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

**Q2: How does B = MAP work? What are M, A, P?**  
`Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt`
- **M (Motivation):** Wanting to do it, but it goes up and down.
- **A (Ability):** How easy it feels. Make the habit super tiny to boost ability.
- **P (Prompt):** The cue that reminds you, like “After brushing teeth...”.

**How to use it**
- Don’t wait for motivation.
- Shrink the habit so it is effortless.
- Link it to a routine you already do.

**Q3: Why celebrate (“Shine”) right after?**  
Celebrating gives a dopamine hit—your brain marks the habit as rewarding. Feeling proud wires the habit faster and keeps you doing it, even when the action is tiny. Celebration can be a smile, “Yes!”, fist pump, or happy thought.

**Why it matters**
- Compounding makes small gains powerful.
- Consistency beats occasional big effort.
- Daily mini wins are enough.

## 4. Atomic Habits – Summary

**Q5: What does the book say about identity?**  
Identity drives habits. “Each action is a vote for the person you want to be.” Focus on becoming the type of person (runner, reader) instead of chasing outcomes (5 km, 20 books). Identity-based habits stick longer.

**Q6: How to make a habit easier?**  
Third Law = Make it Easy.
- Reduce friction: remove steps.
- Two-minute rule: shrink it to a 2-minute starter.
- Environment design: place cues where you see them.
- Automation: reminders, auto-saves, prep ahead.

**Q7: How to make a habit harder?**  
Do the opposite.
- Increase friction: add steps/log out.
- Add obstacles: uninstall, move snacks away.
- Hide cues: keep triggers out of sight.
- Commitment contracts: put money or accountability on the line.

## 5. Reflection

**Q8: Habit to build — Read daily**
- Cue: book on pillow; read right after brushing.
- Attractive: pair with coffee.
- Easy: one page (tiny habit anchor: “After I sit on my bed, I read one page.”)
- Satisfying: celebrate and mark it in a tracker.

**Q9: Habit to cut — Nighttime Instagram scrolling**
- Invisible cue: phone in another room, notifications off.
- Unattractive: remind yourself it ruins sleep; motivational lock screen.
- Hard: log out, remove from home screen, block after 10 pm.
- Unsatisfying: tell a friend to check screen time; pay ₹50 when you slip.
